      A stereotype threat refers to being at risk of confirming a negative stereotype about a certain group. Research has been shown to affect stereotyped individuals performance in a number of domains, including white men in sports and women in driving. Most importantly, stereotype threat can harm the academic performance of any individual for whom the situation invokes a stereotype-based expectation of poor performance. For example, Professor Claude M. Steele did some experiments with some SAT tests. Surprisingly students who had scores of 1500 were getting lower grades than others students. Why is that? We haven't found the answer yet.</p>

      Honestly I had never been affected by a stereotype threat before. Mainly because I've never heard some of the most influential ones, but I rather not know about them since I still have some confidence within myself. However, to give some advice, if I was affected by a stereotype threat, I would think about my family and friends and remember all the positive feelings they have for me. Think about your achievements and why your friends and family believe in you. Heck, talk to them if you have to. Do that, and you would overcome the threat that affects you.
