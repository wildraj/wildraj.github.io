  <h2>Pairing Feedback</h2>

    Pairing is all about teaching and learning from others. This is the main thing I am looking for when I pair with someone for a challenge. We all need each other to learn about ourselves and the world, and most importantly, how to rise to any challenge that is thrown at us. When I pair with someone, I get a little nervous because I think I will slow him/her down in the learning process. However, so far I have never slow down anyone because he/she was very flexible and patient with me. So I decided to be myself from now on and to do my best to help others whenever I can.

    Most of the feedbacks I read were very positive. They said I was cool and flexible with my partners, which gave some confidence about myself. However, the main mistake that was pointed out was that I was controlling too much on both the navigator and the driver roles. To fix that, I need to be more humble and let my partners tell me about their ideas, and use them in some challenges. That is the only mistake I saw in all of my feedbacks. Now when I write feedbacks for my partners, I had a hard time because I am not good at looking at very detailed mistakes, such as they need to use a better screenshare. Although, it was very easy to give positive feedback since they were flexible and did their best to do what they needed to do.
