      Think of the border as the border of a rectangle. Now the margin is the amount of space outside the border while padding is the amount of space between the content and the border inside the rectangle. Be careful when you use margin and padding because they could mess up your element positioning. If you want to mess with them, start with the inner element first, then work with the outer elements.
