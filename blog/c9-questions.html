      From my experience, I think a good question involves either no answer or a deep meaning. It doesn't involve searching through Google for simple answers. Consider this simple question: What's the definition of the word defer? That's pretty easy since you can use dictionary.com to find it. Now look at this question: Does a human being have the right to end his/her life? It's a debatable but a great question. As soon as someone asks you this question, you will feel some contraditions within yourself as you argue to yourself that a certain solution may help, then decided the other solution is better as you go back and forth. That's what involves a great question: contraditions within the solution and yourself.
