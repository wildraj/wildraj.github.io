      Everyone can easily access the internet. However, that is why it can be a very dangerous place. Cyber criminals including predators, bullies, and corrupt businesses will try to take advantage of unwary visitors. Most people placed some valuable information, including SSN and credit card number on the internet. The problem is, cyber criminals can access those information by hacking to harm other people. Here are some examples:<br>
      - Identity thieves: they use the information they find online to drain peoples' bank account or ruin their credit rating.<br>
      - Phishing: a common trick used on websites that have been hacked or are pretending to be legitimates.<br>
      - Popular social networking sites such as Facebook are targets for scams.<br>
      One solution is to leave as little information as possible, or store the in a secure place online. Don't leave any valuable information online, especially a credit card number or a SSN.
