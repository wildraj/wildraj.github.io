      If you have studied JavaScript and Ruby, you will notice that Ruby hashes and JavaScript objects are similar. However, there are a couple of difference syntatically. One is that the key of the JavaScript object can have only one symbol (key:) while Ruby hashes provide multiple (:key, key:) symbols. The other difference is the assignment of a key to the value. Sometimes people use "=>" for non-symbol keys such as strings and integers. However, JavaScript provides only one way for assignment, which is using symbols as keys. In comparison to JavaScript objects Ruby hashes seem to be more flexible as it provides many options for value assignment.
