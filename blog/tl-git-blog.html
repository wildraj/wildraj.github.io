      Describe Version Control.
    </p>
    <p> Version Control is a feature of GitHub that enables it to keep track of everything that happened in all the files stored in the program.
    </p>

    <p>Explain how git tracks changes</p>
    <p>Put it this way, if a person "commits", then "pushes" a file to GitHub, it remembers the changes that occured in that file</p>

    <p>Evaluate the benefits of using GitHub to store code</p>
    <p>Like I said, GitHub can track all the changes that occurred in all files that are stored. What makes GitHub different than any other version controls is that GitHub enables developers to copy a project's folder and then use that as their own centralized folder.
