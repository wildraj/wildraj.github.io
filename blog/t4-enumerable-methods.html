      So before I discuss about the map method, there are two things that are really important. The first is the elements of the list(enumerator). The second is the operation for each element, so keep that in mind.Now, the map method returns an array with the results of the operation for each element. Remember the two important things I mentioned before? They are required if you want the map to work the way you want it to. For example, if you want to make a list of the first 10 numbers times 2, map can do it for you.</p>
      <br>
      Code: (1..10).map{|element| element * 2}<br>
      Squaring numbers: (1..10).map{|element| element * element}<br>
