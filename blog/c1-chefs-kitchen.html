      So according to Shereef, the environment of DBC is similar to Abilene Christian University. The students were friendly and very teachable. The professors are caring people as they help their students any way they can, but only if the students want to learn. This kind of environment helped my develop for the past 5 years. Because of that, I can already tell that I would get a lot out of Dev Bootcamp, especially growth and knowledge of coding. So I am excited to look forward to work my instructors and help other students anyway I can. Do you know why? Because I'm a firefly and I am ready to learn!
