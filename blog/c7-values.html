  <h2>My Values</h2>

      When I think of the times in my life where I've been the happiest, some of these values came to my mind: confidence, excitement, or some free time. When ever I feel proud of myself, I gain more confidence, coolness under fire, and accomplishment of myself.

      In general, with a rating of 1-5 I try to live up to these values with 4 for agreement.

      Last month, a good friend of mine was dismissed from the department of computer science from Texas Tech. He wants me to advise him about his next move. A couple of values came to my mind, which are accomplishments and confidence. Like some people he talked to, I advised him to change majors since he will be graduating next year and he can always come back to that major later. I also told him that college is not the only way to learn computer science. Experience is what is important in this field and he has some of that. That's what I advised him for his next move.

      Most of the values I chose came from hard work, and that's what I'm good of. Again from the stereotype article, I've never experienced any negative feeling from stereotype threats, mainly because I've been busy with work, video games, or hanging out with friends and family. If you are experiencing any negative feeling right now, then talk to the people you know. I did that with my friends and family quite often and it helps, alot.
