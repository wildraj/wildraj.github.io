      So my style of learning is to do things, including practice problems and martial arts movement. In other words, I'm a kinesthetic learner. Since Dev Bootcamp challenges requires tons of problem solving and requiring me to do them, I'm learning a lot in the field of Web Development, especially Ruby. The only problem I have in this is time management and that is my fault, although I am improving throughout the process. However, once I start a task, I never stop until I finish, but to start it is my main problem. Once I get past that, I should be much more efficient.<br>
      People with a growth mindset has the will to learn and aim to develop themselves. They make mistakes, learn from them, and take them into account. However, people with a fixed mindset is the direct opposite. They quit a challenge after one mistake. They think they are perfect and should not make mistakes at all.
