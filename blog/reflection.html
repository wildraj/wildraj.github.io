      I've been meaning to get my portfoliol started after graduation, but I didn't have time for it if it wasn't for Dev Bootcamp so thank you so much for that. It was awesome adding all these blogs to not only reflect what I think about certain topics, but to also reveal my characteristics. I did enjoy updating my porfolio every week and adding some new information about me and my projects. I may not have my resume yet because I don't have it at this time. Along the way I learned some new css tricks including the navigation bar and the overflow: scroll trick. Overall, I'm very happy that this program requires their students to make their portfolio because it is a perfect view for viewers to see what the makers can do.
