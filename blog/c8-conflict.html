      When I pair up with a black belt in a Master's class, I expect him/her to give me a 110% effort and I would do the same. However, a late teen who is a second degree black belt told me to go easier on him on a set. It's true that I am twice as big as him, but when I did the same set in testing, my partner was about four times my size and he gave me 110% of his power in kicks and I was gasping for air for every hit. Now that I think about it, I felt like I'm a target practice that is not allowed to hit back with all my might, which is fine, but a little disappointing. I felt a little disrespectful because there seems to be a lack of trust in my power kicks. This conflict is a little hard to explin, but this is the best I can do. I haven't resolved this problem yet, but I might speak with my master instructor about this issue and see where to go from there. I'm more of a go with the flow person. If I could go back and do things differently, I would speak with Chip a lot sooner. From this experience, I learned to never wait and think about a way to fix the issue. Just do it.
