      Think of an array like a list, except you start counting at 0 instead of 1. An array is a "list variable." For example, if you want to store multiple names, then an array is highly recommended. Say you want to store Rajal, Bob, Charlie. All you have to do is "push" (exact code) them in and Ruby will add the names in the array for you. So if I store the names in that order, then array[0] is Rajal, array[1] is Bob, and array[2] is Charlie. Keep in mind that you need to use an index to track the name you want in the array. If I want Rajal, then I need the index 0. That's it. That's the basics of arrays. Now the hash tables are really cool. Bascially you can make a person, for simplicity sake. You need 2 things: a key and some data (ie: NAME: "Rajal"). Now to call a specific characteristic of a person, all you have to do is call a person with his/her key, ex: person.NAME. Arrays and hashes are very useful once you know how to use them.
